              <p class="slide__content mb28">
                “In my GI endoscopy unit of hospital, there are 4 PENTAX Medical IMAGINA Video Endoscope Systems with 16 gastroscopes and 12 colonoscopes. The first time IMAGINA system were installed in 2020, some endoscopists experienced minor difficulties in controlling the new endoscope due to some differences (e.g.: close position of the buttons, i-scan, feeling from the shaft, i-pad style touch panel, et al.) from existing ones of the other supplier.<br>
                But I easily get used to the PENTAX Medical IMAGINA endoscope system before long.<br>
                The major advantages of clinical case with IMAGINA are the excellent quality vof close-up image and the function of high degree angulation. It is convenient to make high quality video clips using the 2 USB ports (please don't forget to use the most recent version of USB memory).”

              <p class="slide__content mb68">
                Advanced gastric cancer Borrmann type IV is the most important disease entity in terms of endoscopic examination of the stomach.<br>
                It is easy for endoscopists to miss due to the lack of definite mucosal lesion.<br>
                It is more common in young woman even in the 30’s and 40’s.<br>
                Ulcerative lesion is found in about 30% of cases. In cases without ulcer or erosion, it is difficult to decide where to do the biopsies.<br>
                The sensitivity of the biopsy is very low in this situation.<br>
                When it is clinically suspected, the surgical exploration is necessary even without histological evidence.<br>
                The curative surgical resection is possible in less than 30% of the cases, and the long-term survival cases are rare

                    Initially you can see the thickened folds and narrowed interval between folds.<br>
                    The antrum does not seem to be involved by the diffuse type malignancy.<br>
                    The border between the involved and normal areas looks like somewhere between lower body and proximal antrum.<br>

                The i-scan has comparable diagnostic accuracies for the histologic prediction of intermediate-to-large colorectal polyps. Furthermore, the inter-observer agreement and intra-observer agreement were acceptable for i-scan when the JNET classification was applied. JNET type 1 is characterized by changes in normal vessels and mucosal patterns, as well as the presence of dark and white spots.<br>
                Type 2A is characterized by vessels of a regular caliber and a normal distribution pattern.<br>
                Type 2B is characterized by vessels of a variable caliber with an irregular distribution pattern and an obscure mucosal pattern. Type 3 is defined as a vessel pattern that is typified by areas of interrupted thick vessels and a mucosal pattern involving amorphous areas.
